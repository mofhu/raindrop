3. clone or download `raindrop.py`
4. `$python raindrop.py`

    - how many percent time you actually used
    - how is your efficiency
- [] report analyzer for long-term monitoring and feedback analysis of your `raindrops`

## Miscellaneous

### Why this App called `raindrop`?

- raindrop is a metaphor of everyday time. The model is to collect time as raindrops - raindrops will finally form a river, moving unstoppable to its destination - the ocean.

### Why there is some quotes?

We believe that proper recall of quotes may help people live happier and more meaningful (that's `for human-being` means).

### Minor points

- license: MIT (i.e. feel free to reuse and make your own version)
- raindrop is inspired partly by [Timebox](https://github.com/visini/timebox).
- for principles, Ray Dalio's [Principles](https://principles.com/) is highly recommended by us.
